Use this area to try out how Findeco works. If you want to create something meaningful use another area.

== Subsections ==
Every proposal in Findeco consists of some text and a list of subsections under this text. The list of subsections may
be empty. Every subsection represents its own discussion with alternatives and refinements. However in the parent layer
you will not see anything of this discussion as only the most popular text from there gets included under the heading
of the subsection.

=== Subsections of Subsections ===
It is important to navigate to the section you want to refine or where you want to propose something new. There you
find the relevant comments (microblogging) and arguments.

== Arguments ==
Arguments are always next to the proposal where they were created. So please make sure to navigate to the right
proposal before creating your argument because otherwise it will be misplaced and users may ignore it.

=== Arguments for Refinements ===
For every refinement of an existing proposal you have to supply an argument which explains why the refinement was
necessary. This argument is added at the refined proposal.

Refinements also inherit copies of all arguments. If they do not match the text of the proposal anymore you can remove
your follow mark.

== Improving the Structure ==
If you find a proposal with a bad structure you may improve the structure by creating a refinement. You can reorder
the subsections and you can add new subsections if you need them. You can even refine a proposal from somewhere else
to build a new subsection of your refined proposal.

Every subsection marks a new topic so keep different ideas separated to increase the productivity of your discussions.
